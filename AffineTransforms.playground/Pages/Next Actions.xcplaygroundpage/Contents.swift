 So you think you're all done? Here's some optional quests.

 * Replace the duck with your social media avatar or a favorite Sesame Street character.
 
 * What transform flips the duck so it's facing left?

 * Volunteer to help someone near you. Explaining something is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

 * Brainstorm other coding topics that could be taught with a playground.

 * Team up with someone on the other platform and talk about the differences between Xcode and iPad playground user experiences.

* *Xcode*: Take a peek in TransformPuzzleVC.swift in the `Sources` folder and add your own puzzles.
 
* *Xcode*: Add the following line of code to the bottom of one of the other pages in this playground. Notice the six numbers.

    `print(duck.transform)`

    Then go read more about the math in [Apple's reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Conceptual/drawingwithquartz2d/dq_affine/dq_affine.html)
 
    Note that it's the same as the transforms used in the [SVG image format](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/coords.html#EstablishingANewUserSpace), even though they lay out the matrices differently.
