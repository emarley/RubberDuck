// So you think you're all done, eh? Here's some optional quests.

// * Replace the duck with your twitter avatar.

// * Take a peek in TransformPuzzleVC.swift in the sources folder and try adding your own puzzles.

// * Add the following line of code to the bottom of one of the other pages in this playground.

// print(duck.transform)

// Then go read more about the math at the bottom of this page: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Conceptual/drawingwithquartz2d/dq_affine/dq_affine.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001066-CH204-TPXREF101

// * What transform flips the duck so it's facing left?

// * Brainstorm other coding topics that could be taught with a playground.

// * Get in touch with me: @emarley or lizamarley@gmail.com
