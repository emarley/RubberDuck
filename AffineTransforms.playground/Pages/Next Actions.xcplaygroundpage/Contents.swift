 So you think you're all done, eh? Here's some optional quests.

* Replace the duck with your twitter avatar.
 
* What transform flips the duck so it's facing left?

* Take a peek in TransformPuzzleVC.swift in the sources folder and try adding your own puzzles.

* Add the following line of code to the bottom of one of the other pages in this playground.

`print(duck.transform)`

Then go read more about the math in [Apple's reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Conceptual/drawingwithquartz2d/dq_affine/dq_affine.html)
 
For extreme bonus points, note that it's the same as the transforms used in the [SVG image format](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/coords.html#EstablishingANewUserSpace), even though they lay out the matrices differently.

* Brainstorm other coding topics that could be taught with a playground.
